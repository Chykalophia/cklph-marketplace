## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-30

### Added — 11 new skills
- **`testing`** — Vitest + Playwright coverage tiers; what to test by layer (services for breadth, routes for smoke, hooks selectively); **mock the data-layer, not the network**; integration tests against a Supabase branch for real-DB confidence.
- **`server-actions`** — the `"use server"` boundary in Next.js 15+: when to use a server action vs an API route, return `ServiceResult<T>` (never throw to the form), form-action pattern with `useFormStatus()`, security checklist still applies.
- **`supabase-migrations`** — CLI-first workflow (`supabase migration new` → SQL → `db push`), RLS policy template per user-data table, rollback discipline for destructive changes, index naming convention.
- **`qstash`** — Upstash QStash for background jobs: signature verification at the route boundary, deterministic job IDs + DB state tracking (`pending → processing → completed/failed`), return-200-on-non-retryable, cron-enqueues-fast.
- **`pubsub`** — Google Cloud Pub/Sub webhooks: **always 200** (no retry storm), JWT verification via `OAuth2Client` (audience + issuer + email), atomic deduplication with optimistic locking, BigInt comparison for large IDs (`historyId`), 7-day watch renewal cron.
- **`config`** — typed env vars (Zod / `@t3-oss/env-nextjs`) + **graceful-degradation** pattern from next-forge — only the DB env is required; optional integrations silently disable when their env is missing (feature off, not error).
- **`postgres`** — PostgreSQL on Supabase: btree default with partial / covering indexes; `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` before assuming a problem; pgbouncer transaction-vs-session-mode; N+1 prevention; JSONB `gin` indexing.
- **`ui-quality`** — dark mode + WCAG AA deep dive: every color paired with `dark:` variant; contrast 4.5:1 / 3:1; `:focus-visible` always; keyboard nav; ARIA; color-is-never-the-only-signal; screen-reader smoke tests.
- **`auth`** — Supabase auth flows beyond the mutation checklist: `getUser()` server-side / `useUser()` client-side, OAuth callback with PKCE, password reset, multi-tenant `organization_id` in RLS, where auth code lives (layouts + middleware, not leaf components).
- **`error-handling`** — `ServiceResult<T, ServiceError>` (never throw from services), user-surface vs log-only text discipline, observability capture **at the route boundary only** (no double-capture), recoverable vs non-recoverable differentiation.
- **`data-model`** — the Supabase-generated `lib/types/database.ts` is the source of truth — how to read `Row` / `Insert` / `Update` / `Enums` / `Functions` types; never hand-roll a row type; regenerate after every migration and commit alongside; use generated types in service signatures.

### Enhanced
- **`pitfalls`** (60 → 84 lines) — one-line WRONG-code example under each of the 12 patterns. The catalog stays symptom-only; fixes live in `cklph-os:debugging`. Emoji marker stripped per house style.
- **`security`** (47 → 58 lines) — new "Specific attack vectors" section: SQL injection (parameterize via SDK), IDOR (app-layer ownership check + RLS as net), XSS (`dangerouslySetInnerHTML` sanitize + `<a href>` scheme validation), path traversal (`path.resolve` + `startsWith`), open redirect (allowlist), secrets-in-URL / log.
- **`discipline`** — adds the regen-types-after-migration rule (`supabase gen types typescript --linked > lib/types/database.ts` in the same commit as the migration). See `data-model`.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-05-30

### Added
- **"Why these layers"** section in `architecture` — each layer cited against the principle it enforces
  from `cklph-os:design` (SRP for services, DIP for data-layer, OCP for middleware, SRP+ISP for
  security, DRY for utils, SRP for validation). Surfaces the *rationale*, doesn't teach the principles.

### Fixed
- `architecture` final line no longer references the non-existent `service-layer-patterns` skill — that
  content was absorbed into `architecture` + `api-routes` during the v0.1.0 distillation. Replaced with
  pointers to `api-routes`, `security`, and `cklph-os:design`.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-30

### Added — initial release
- **`architecture`** — layered `lib/` structure (services / data / middleware / security / utils / validation): what each layer owns and the rule that components don't reach into services directly.
- **`security`** — ordered mutation checklist: rate-limit FIRST · CSRF on state-change · `getUser()` not `getSession()` · Zod on all input · correct Supabase client by intent (`createServerSupabaseClient` · `createClient` · `createServiceRoleClient` ONLY after admin check or in cron).
- **`api-routes`** — route handler patterns: `compose()` middleware (`requireAuth` + `rateLimit` + `csrfValidate`), `ServiceResult<T>` typed success/failure shape, `dynamic = "force-dynamic"` for webhooks, `verifyCronAuth` for cron.
- **`data-layer`** — no raw `fetch("/api/...")` in components or hooks; route everything through `lib/data/` (`authFetcher` / `useAuthQuery` / `useAuthMutation`) for 401 refresh-retry, CSRF, cache dedupe, and invalidation. Semgrep rule `no-raw-fetch-to-api-in-client-code` enforces it.
- **`pitfalls`** — the 12 cumulative review pitfalls catalog (React updater purity, optimistic-update drift, toggle idempotency, Supabase `range()` inclusivity, `{count: "exact"}` for pagination, partial-select `Pick<T>` typing, JSON.parse before Zod, state-machine catch blocks, service-role in auth routes, finite-value `string` → union types, control flow after error checks, 500-line file limit).
- **`discipline`** — cross-cutting rules (Tailwind+ShadCN only · search-before-create · security on ALL mutations · correct Supabase client · Stripe prices from `pricing_tiers` table · migrations via CLI not MCP for DDL · DRY at 3+ · branch safety · dark mode + WCAG AA on all new UI · zero `any` · client fetches through `lib/data/` · 500-line file limit).

### Composition with `vercel:*`
This plugin is **layered on top of**, not a replacement for, the official `vercel:*` skills. `vercel:*` covers Next.js + React + Vercel framework patterns (`vercel:nextjs`, `vercel:react-best-practices`, `vercel:routing-middleware`, `vercel:shadcn`, `vercel:turbopack`, `vercel:auth`, `vercel:ai-sdk`); `cklph-nextjs` covers Peter's house style on top.

### Distilled from
Surviving MailPrism `.claude/skills/` after the v0.7.1 cleanup pass (`layered-architecture`, `security-patterns`, `api-route-patterns`, `service-layer-patterns`, `api-error-handling`, `component-standards`, `ui-quality-standards`) plus MailPrism's `AGENTS.md` "Critical Rules" and "Common Review Pitfalls" sections — generalized to be reusable across all Peter's Next.js + Supabase repos.
